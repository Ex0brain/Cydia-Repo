##Overview
**Cydia-Repo**, host your own cydia repo for packages you make. So, start hosting.
##You To-Do
1. Update the file called Release. It is very self-explanatory. You just replace the parenthesis with your repo-specific stuff.
2. Update the CydiaIcon.png file. This is a 60x60 png file that cydia uses for your repo icon.
3. Update rupdate. That is a shell script I put in there to make updating the repo easy.
4. Install dpkg-deb. On OS X this can be done with macports.
